# gps-tracker
**We are using arduino uno board and neo-6mv2(GPS module).**
A GPS tracking unit, geo tracking unit, satellite tracking unit, or simply tracker is a navigation device normally determine its movement and determine its WGS84 UTM geographic position (geo tracking) to determine its location.
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on ATmega328P(datasheet). It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller, simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
The NEO-6MV2 is a GPS (Global Positioning System) module and is used for navigation. The module simply checks its location on earth and provides output data which is longitude and latitude of its position. (16 x 12.2 x 2.4 mm) package.
