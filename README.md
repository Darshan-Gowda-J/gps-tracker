# gps-tracker
A GPS tracking unit, geo tracking unit, satellite tracking unit, or simply tracker is a navigation device normally on a vehicle, asset, person or animal that uses satellite navigation to determine its movement and determine its WGS84 UTM geographic position (geo tracking) to determine its location.[1] Satellite tracking devices send special satellite signals that are processed by a receiver.
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on ATmega328P(datasheet). It has 14 digital input output pins (of which 6 are used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller, simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. You can tinker with your UNO without worrying too much about doing something wrong, worst-case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again.
The NEO-6MV2 is a GPS (Global Positioning System) module and is used for navigation. The module simply checks its location on earth and provides output data which is longitude and latitude of its position. It is from a family of stand-alone GPS receivers featuring the high performance u-blox 6 positioning engine. These flexible and cost effective receivers offer numerous connectivity options in a miniature (16 x 12.2 x 2.4 mm) package. The compact architecture, power and memory options make NEO-6 modules ideal for battery operated mobile devices with very strict cost and space constraints. Its Innovative design gives NEO-6MV2 excellent navigation performance even in the most challenging environments.
